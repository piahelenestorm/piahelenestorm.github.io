            <div class="case-hero-wrapper">
                <p class="case-description">SUNDSAMMEN was a real-life project in the 6th semester of the bachelor
                    'Digital Concept
                    Development'. As a part of a team of 4 people consisting of user researchers and designers we
                    collborated with
                    UCL and the Steno Diabetes Center in Denmark to create a concept with the goal of helping and
                    motivating busy parents with small children to achieve a
                    healthier everyday life. The concept was built around a health and wellness app with available
                    mini-courses that the user could pick and choose from according to their schedule
                    and motivation level. <br><br>

                    In addition, the app offers podcasts about health and relationships as well as a recipe universe
                    with easy and healthy recipes. A key part of the concept is the use of nudging to help motivate
                    the users to stay on track on
                    their chosen courses and to keep making the more healthy choice in the everyday life.</p>

            <h2 class="case-title">THE PROBLEM</h2>
            <p class="case-description">Parents of young children often have a very busy everyday life and therefore
                lack the resources and mental energy to prioritize their own health. As a result they have a tendency to
                end up with a liftestyle based on what is easiest
                and least time-consuming. At the same time, the healthcare system lacks the resources to be able to
                guide parents of young children on how to achieve better
                health after becoming parents. This can result in an increased risk of developing certain lifestyle
                diseases, such as diabetes, among this target group.
                <br> <br>

                Most health and wellness apps on the market today are targeted a group who has a more flexible everyday
                life and who has more time to carry out fixed training programmes, than parents of small children do.
                Therefore, the goal was to develop a solution that
                focuses on improving the overall health of parents of small children, while also taking into account,
                that they have very busy and unpredictable everyday lives.

            </p>

            <p class="hero-text2">
                How might we help parents with young children to have a healthier everyday life?
