                <div class="case-hero-wrapper">
                    <p class="case-description">SUNDSAMMEN was a real-life project in the 6th semester of the bachelor
                        'Digital Concept
                        Development'. As a part of a team of 4 people consisting of user researchers and designers we
                        collborated with
                        UCL and the Steno Diabetes Center in Denmark to create a concept with the goal of helping and
                        motivating busy parents with small children to achieve a
                        healthier everyday life. The concept was built around a health and wellness app with available
                        mini-courses that the user could pick and choose from according to their schedule
                        and motivation level. <br><br>

                        In addition, the app offers podcasts about health and relationships as well as a recipe universe
                        with easy and healthy recipes. A key part of the concept is the use of nudging to help motivate
                        the users to stay on track on
                        their chosen courses and to keep making the more healthy choice in the everyday life.</p>

                <h2 class="case-title">THE PROBLEM</h2>
                <p class="case-description">Parents with young children often have a very busy everyday life and
                    therefore
                    lack the resources and mental energy to prioritize their own health. As a result they have a
                    tendency to end up with a liftestyle based on what is easiest
                    and least time-consuming. At the same time, the healthcare system lacks the resources to be able to
                    guide parents with young children on how to achieve better
                    health after becoming parents. This can result in an increased risk of developing certain lifestyle
                    diseases, such as diabetes, among this target group.
                    <br> <br>

                    Most health and wellness apps on the market today are targeted a group who has a more flexible
                    everyday life and who has more time to carry out fixed training programmes, than parents with small
                    children
                    do. Therefore, the goal was to develop a solution that
                    focuses on improving the overall health of parents with small children, while also taking into
                    account, that they have very busy and unpredictable everyday lives.

                            children about their daily health and what challenges they have in relation
                            to this, as well as what functions they would like in a health app. There were 78 responses,
                            69 of which were women.</p>

                        <p class="case-description">According to the respondents, one of the biggest reasons why they
                            opt out of the healthy choices in everyday life is that they feel they lack time and energy,
                            and at the same time they
                            feel bad about having to spend time away from the children.
                            The majority of the respondents expressed that they would love to get access to quick and
                            effective training routines, that they can perform at any time during the day as well as
                            quick and healthy recipes.

                            2 women and 3 men from the target group. The purpose of the interviews was to elaborate on
                            the struggles the parents face in relation
                            to keeping a healthy lifestyle.

                            interviewees could see themselves using a health
                            app in order to achieve a healthier life, but the general consensus was, that in order to
                            achieve a healthier lifestyle,
                            the app should offer effective and flexible training routines that could be performed at any
                            time, considering the difficulty of planning the day ahead.
                            The also said that they would love to get notifications to be motivated and reminded of
                            working out.

                            representing the moms and dads from the target group. The moms generally expressed that
                            they had a hard time prioritizing themselves and felt bad when doing so. At the same time
                            many of the moms said they found it difficult "letting go of control" and
                            letting the dad get more responsibility of taking care of the home and the kids.<br><br>
                            Meanwhile, the dads generally said, that they found it difficult to understand how they
                            could support the moms in the best way. They also had same wishes
                            as the moms, of being better at prioritising their health in order to become a better
                            partner and parent.

                            To get an overview of the users' journey in relation to the app, we created a User Journey
                            Map.
                            Here, the users' journey is mapped from the initial decision-making proces, and shows their
                            experiences and emotions
                            along the journey.
                            <br><br>
                            It is expected that the users are made aware of the app though an indirect touchpoint such
                            as social media, “word
                            of mouth” from friends and family or from healthcare professionals. While using the app
                            there can be times where the users lack the time or
                            motivation to keep following a workout, and therefore it is necessary that the users are
                            reminded to keep prioritising themselves, otherwise it might
                            result in them abandoning the app all together.

                <p class="case-description">Based on the previous insights, it was decided that the app should be built 
                    around a concept, where the parents can either pick and choose workouts from a built-in library or they can sign up
                    for mini-courses that fits their current level of fitness and available time schedule.<br><br> Moreover they should have access to a library of recipes, that 
                    are all quick and easy to make. Lastly they should have access to a library of podcasts about
                    parenthood and how to achieve a better health - both mentally and physical. Prior to starting the design, we created 3 design principles that summarizes
                    the goal of the solution, and to guide us
                    through the design proces:
