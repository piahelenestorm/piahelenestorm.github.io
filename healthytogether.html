                    <p class="text-dark padding-text">
                        As a result they have a tendency to end up with a liftestyle based on what is easiest
                        and least time-consuming, thus putting them in risk of developing diabetes or other health-related issues. 
                        The problem with most health and wellness apps on the market today are
                        that they target people who have a more flexible everyday life than parents with small children
                        do. In collaboration with UCL and the Steno Diabetes Center, we would create a solution to support 
                        parents with small kids on their journey to a more healthy lifestyle.

                        The team sent out a questionnaire to 78 parents from
                        the target
                        group and carried out 5 face-to-face interviews, to investigate
                        what is keeping them from living a healthier life. A majority of the respondents from the
                        questionnaire felt
                        that they lack the energy to work out and make healthy dinners, just as they can't
                        find time in the busy day where they won't be
                        interrupted.
                        <br><br>
                        These findings were verified in the face-to-face interviews, which is why it was decided,
                        that a key part of the solution should be the use of nudging
                        in form of notifications, to gently remind the parents about the mini-courses
                        they are a part of and messages about how also small steps can have a big
                        effect on their health.
                        <br><br>
                        To meet the parents' unpredictable everyday life, a
                        built-in library was created with mini-courses and short, but effective,
                        training sessions that can be paused and started again as needed. The mini-courses are
                        divided into the categories 'Workouts', 'Diet' and 'Sleep' for a more
                        holistic approach to health.

                        they would primarily use the app to get inspiration for recipes and healthy food. Although being
                        a core function
                        of the app, 2 out of 5 wanted the option to deny notifications entirely, as too many
                        notifications would have a
                        negative impact on their stress levels.

                        Based on the results from the usability tests, it was concluded that
                        'Healthy Together' in theory <i>could</i> help busy parents achieve a healthier
                        life. However, it would be necessary to create a beta version of the app to be tested by a
                        segment from the target group
                        over a longer period, in order to prove that the concept can improve their health in practice.
