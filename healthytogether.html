                            busy lives and therefore lack the energy to

                            As a result they have a tendency to end up with a liftestyle based on what is easiest
                            and least time-consuming, thus putting them in risk of developing diabetes or other
                            health-related issues.
                            The problem with most health and wellness apps on the market today are
                            that they target people who have a more flexible everyday life than parents with small
                            children do. In collaboration with UCL and the Steno Diabetes Center, we would create a
                            solution to
                            support parents with small kids on their journey to a more healthy lifestyle.

                        Based on the results from the usability tests, it was concluded that
                        'Healthy Together' in theory <i>could</i> help busy parents achieve a healthier
                        life. However, it would be necessary to create a beta version of the app to be tested by a
                        segment from the target group
                        over a longer period, in order to prove that the concept can improve their health in practice.
