                <div class="case-hero-wrapper">
                    <p class="case-description">'Healthy Together' was a real-life project during the 6th semester of the bachelor
                        'Digital Concept Development'. As a part of a team of 4 people consisting of user researchers and designers we
                        collaborated with UCL and the Steno Diabetes Center in Denmark to create a concept with <span class="bold">the goal of helping and
                        motivating busy parents with small children to achieve a healthier everyday life.</span> The concept was built around a health and wellness app with available
                        mini-courses that the user could pick and choose from according to their schedule
                        and motivation level. <br><br>

                        In addition, the app offers podcasts about health and relationships as well as a recipe universe
                        with easy and healthy recipes. A key part of the concept is the use of nudging to help motivate
                        the users to stay on track on
                        their chosen courses and to keep making the more healthy choice in the everyday life.</p>

                <h2 class="case-title">THE PROBLEM</h2>
                <p class="case-description"><span class="bold">Parents with young children often have a very busy everyday life and
                    therefore
                    lack the resources and mental energy to prioritize their own health</span>. As a result they have a
                    tendency to end up with a liftestyle based on what is easiest
                    and least time-consuming. At the same time, the healthcare system lacks the resources to be able to
                    guide parents with young children on how to achieve better
                    health after becoming parents. This can result in an increased risk of developing certain lifestyle
                    diseases, such as diabetes, among this target group.
                    <br> <br>

                    <span class="bold">Most health and wellness apps on the market today are targeted a group who has a more flexible
                    everyday life</span>  and who has more time to carry out fixed training programmes, than parents with small
                    children
                    do. Therefore, the goal was to develop a solution that
                    focuses on improving the overall health of parents with small children, while also taking into
                    account, that they have very busy and unpredictable everyday lives.

                            children about their daily health and what challenges they have in relation
                            to this, as well as what functions they would like in a health app. There were 78 responses,

                        <p class="case-description">According to the respondents, <span class="bold">one of the biggest reasons why they
                            opt out of the healthy choices in everyday life is that they feel they lack time and energy</span>,
                            and at the same time they
                            feel bad about having to spend time away from the children.
                            The majority of the respondents expressed that they would love to get access to quick and
                            effective training routines, that they can perform at any time during the day as well as
                            quick and healthy recipes.

                        <p class="case-description">To verify the findings from the questionnaire we carried out 5
                            semi-structured interviews with
                            2 women and 3 men from the target group. The purpose of the interviews was to elaborate on
                            the struggles the parents face in relation
                            to keeping a healthy lifestyle.

                            healthier diet, but that at the same time they lacked motivation for this. 4 out of the 5
                            interviewees could see themselves using a health
                            app in order to achieve a healthier life, but the general consensus was, that in order to
                            achieve a healthier lifestyle,
                            the app should offer effective and flexible training routines that could be performed at any
                            time, considering the difficulty of planning the day ahead.
                            The also said that they would love to get notifications to be motivated and reminded of
                            working out.

                            representing the moms and dads from the target group. The moms generally expressed that
                            they had a hard time prioritizing themselves and felt bad when doing so. At the same time
                            many of the moms said they found it difficult "letting go of control" and
                            letting the dad get more responsibility of taking care of the home and the kids.<br><br>
                            Meanwhile, the dads generally said, that they found it difficult to understand how they
                            could support the moms in the best way. They also had same wishes
                            as the moms, of being better at prioritising their health in order to become a better
                            partner and parent.

                        <h3>User Journey Map</h3>
                        <p class="case-description">
                            To get an overview of the users' journey in relation to the app, we created a User Journey
                            Map.
                            Here, the users' journey is mapped from the initial decision-making proces, and shows their
                            experiences and emotions
                            along the journey.
                            <br><br>
                            It is expected that the users are made aware of the app though an indirect touchpoint such
                            as social media, “word
                            of mouth” from friends and family or from healthcare professionals. While using the app
                            there can be times where the users lack the time or
                            motivation to keep following a workout, and therefore it is necessary that the users are
                            reminded to keep prioritising themselves, otherwise it might
                            result in them abandoning the app all together.

                <h2 class="case-title padding2">DESIGNING THE CONCEPT</h2>
                <p class="case-description">Based on the previous insights, it was decided that the app should be built 
                    around a concept, where the parents can either pick and choose workouts from a built-in library or they can sign up
                    for mini-courses that fits their current level of fitness and available time schedule.<br><br> Moreover they should have access to a library of recipes, that 
                    are all quick and easy to make. Lastly they should have access to a library of podcasts about
                    parenthood and how to achieve a better health - both mentally and physical. Prior to starting the design, we created 3 design principles that summarizes
                    the goal of the solution, and to guide us
                    through the design proces:

                <div class="title-text-wrapper padding">
                    <p class="case-description">The app offers a library of built-in workouts and mini-courses, all divided according to available time, motivation
                        and the level of fitness. Furthermore the mini-courses are divided into the categories 'Workouts', 'Diet' and 'Sleep' for a more holistic
                        approach to health.

                <div class="title-text-wrapper padding">
                    <p class="case-description">A key part of the solution is the use of nudging in the form of notifications. The users are reminded daily of the mini-courses 
                        they are a part of and are getting gentle messages about how small steps can have a big affect on their health. There is a big focus on the tone of voice in 
                        the app and a big part of that is the use of positive language. The purpose of this is to gently motivate the parents, especially the moms, who had expressed
                        many feelings of guilt concerning their health and taking time away from their kids.

                    <p class="case-description">During the project a Design System was created in order to get an overview and structure of the design's elements, including e.g. colors, icons, elements, typography and 
                        images. The development of the design system has been based on Brad Frost's "Atomic Design", to ensure a consistent design across all platforms, and to support a component-based way of thinking.
                        <br><br>Early in the design proces functional patterns were defined to help support the user's behavior and actions. The nav-bar in the bottom of the 
                        app menu provides the users with an easy access to navigate the app's content at any time. The tab-bar that can be found on the mini-courses page, 
                        gives the user the opportunity to choose between the different levels of difficulty, depending on what level they are. Lastly, the carousel is used on most of the 
                    pages to showcase multiple rows of content.
                
                <br><br>
                Likewise the team defined several perceptual patterns to create a consistency through the app and to elevate it's brand. It was essential that the solution reflected the users' environment, which often involves a busy and unpredictable everyday life. 
                Therefore, it we decided on a color palette that gives the user a feeling of simplicity and wellness.

                    <p class="case-description">The prototype was tested by 5 parents from the target group (3 women and 2 men). The usabily tests was conducted as a Concurrent
                        Think Aloud, with the purpose of examining the participants feelings towards the app's concept and the usability of the app.<br><br>
                        The test was held at the homes of the participants in the busiest hours of the day in order to test the usability of the app while in a semi-stressful environment.
                        During the test the participants was asked to think aloud while performing 7 main tasks. The test administrator could ask follow-up questions during the task in case the 
                        participants said something that needed elaboration.

                            available time, where the rest believed that they would primarily use the app to get inspiration for recipes and healthy food.
                            In relation to the content, all the women thought the content sounded really exciting, where all the men wished they could 
                            access content more specific to the. 
                            <br><br>Although being a core function of the app, 2 of the 5 participants wanted there to be an option to opt out of notifications entirely, as this would have a negative impact 
                            on their experience.

                    <p class="case-description">Based on the results from the usability testing, it was concluded that an app build around the concept of mini-courses and 
                        the use of nudging could help busy parents with small children achieve a healthier life. However, based on the wishes of the dads, there should be made 
                        some adjustments to make the app feel as welcoming to the dads. This includes creating a section with special content targeted men and 
                        their specific needs and challenges in relation to their health.
