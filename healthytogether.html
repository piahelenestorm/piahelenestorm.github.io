                                'Digital Concept Development', where we collaborated with UCL and the Steno Diabetes Center
                                in Denmark to create a concept with the goal of helping and
                                    motivating busy parents with small children to achieve a healthier everyday life.</p>

                    <p class="case-description">Parents with young children often have a very busy
                            everyday life and therefore lack the resources and mental energy to prioritize their own health. As a result they
                        have a tendency to end up with a liftestyle based on what is easiest
                        and least time-consuming. 
                        <br> <br>

                        The problem with most health and wellness apps on the market today are that
                            they target people who have a more flexible
                            everyday life than parents with small children do.

                            <p class="case-description">First of all, we sent out a questionnaire to parents with young
                                children about their daily health and what challenges they have in relation
                                to this, as well as which functions they would like in a health app. There were 78 responses,
                                    69 of which were women.</p>

                            <p class="case-description">According to the respondents, one of major reasons why they
                                    opt out of the healthy choices in everyday life is that they feel they lack time and
                                    energy,
                                and that they feel bad about having to spend time away from the children.
                                The majority of the respondents expressed that they wanted access to quick
                                and
                                effective training routines, that they can perform at any time during the day as well as
                                quick and healthy recipes.

                            <p class="case-description">To verify the findings from the questionnaire we carried out
                                5 semi-structured interviews with 2 women and 3 men from the target group. The purpose of the interviews were
                                to elaborate on the struggles the parents face in relation
                                to keeping a healthy lifestyle.

                                would use a health app if it offered short and flexible training routines that could be performed
                                at any time during the day. 3 out of 5 also said, that they would love to receive notifications to be reminded of working out and to take care
                                    of themselves.

                                representing the moms and dads from the target group. The moms generally expressed that
                                they had a hard time prioritizing themselves and felt bad when doing so. At the same
                                time
                                many of the moms said they found it difficult "letting go of control" and
                                letting the dad get more responsibility of taking care of the home and the kids.<br><br>
                                Meanwhile, the dads generally said, that they found it difficult to understand how they
                                could support the moms in the best way. They also had same wishes
                                as the moms, of being better at prioritising their health in order to become a better
                                partner and parent.

                                To get an overview of the users' journey in relation to the app, we created a User

                                Map.
                                Here, the users' journey is mapped from the initial decision-making proces, and shows
                                their
                                experiences and emotions

                                motivation to keep following a workout, and therefore it is necessary
                                    that the users are
                                    reminded to keep prioritising themselves, otherwise it might
                                    result in them abandoning the app all together.

                    <p class="case-description">Based on the insights it was decided that the app should be
                        built around a concept, where the parents can either pick and choose workouts from
                            a built-in library or they can sign up
                            for mini-courses that fits their current level of fitness and available time
                            schedule.<br><br> Moreover they should have access to a library of recipes, that
                        are all quick and easy to make. Lastly they should have access to a library of podcasts about
                        parenthood and how to achieve a better health - both mentally and physical. Prior to starting
                        the design, we created 3 design principles that summarizes
                        the goal of the solution, and to guide us

                            and the level of fitness. Furthermore the mini-courses are divided into the categories
                            'Workouts', 'Diet' and 'Sleep' for a more holistic
                            approach to health.

                                effect on their health. The purpose of this is to
                            gently motivate the parents, especially the moms, who had expressed
                            many feelings of guilt concerning their health and taking time away from their kids.

                        some adjustments to make the app feel as welcoming to the dads.
