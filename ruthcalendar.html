                            <p class="case-description">I'm co-founder of 'Ruth Calendar', a non-profit project with the
                                mission of creating an
                                acessible digital planner, that can be tailored to fit the users' vision challenges.
                                It is created in close collaboration with low vision users, and is currently still under
                                construction. <br><br>
                                The team behind consists of 3 people, where I have worked primarily with UX research,
                                interaction design and visual design.
                                Along the way I also contributed with frontend development whenever possible. From the

                    <p class="case-description">In the modern world it has become essential for many to
                        plan and organize activities to create structure in their everyday life and to remember
                        important events. However, people with low vision can experience severe challenges using
                        digital planners due to
                        insufficient text sizes and bad color contrasts.
                        <br> <br>

                        For some, they experience so many problems that they completely give up keeping a planner
                        themselves, and therefore become completely dependent on their relatives to keep track of their
                        own
                        lives.
                        The goal of the project is therefore to create a solution that gives people with low vision
                        their
                        independence back.

                                million people globally live with impaired vision. Most often
                                this is due to eye diseases such as cataract, glaucomas, age-related macular

                                    in September 2022. Rikke works daily as
                                    team leader for the vision consultants who take on
                                    home visits to citizens with impaired vision, where Ole is
                                    IT expert within the work with accessible
                                    web solutions.

                                    The aim of the interview was to obtain qualitative knowledge
                                    through conversation with professionals who know a wide
                                    sample of the design needs that may arise with people
                                    with impaired vision. Furthermore, the interview had a purpose
                                    to uncover the challenges that vision consultants
                                    experiences when setting up digital devices at
                                    people with reduced vision, and what challenges they face

                                    of their sight back, but they also work with
                                    people with late sequelae of concussion (PCS), who
                                    suffer from visual disturbances in everyday life.

                                    settings available, and therefore they find that they often

                    <p class="case-description">Based on the previous insights, it was decided that the app should be
                        built
                        around a concept, where the parents can either pick and choose workouts from a built-in library
                        or
                        they can sign up
                        for mini-courses that fits their current level of fitness and available time schedule.<br><br>
                        Moreover they should have access to a library of recipes, that
                        are all quick and easy to make. Lastly they should have access to a library of podcasts about
                        parenthood and how to achieve a better health - both mentally and physical. Prior to starting
                        the
                        design, we created 3 design principles that summarizes
                        the goal of the solution, and to guide us
                        through the design proces:

                            'Workouts', 'Diet' and 'Sleep' for a more holistic

                                However, based on the wishes of the dads, there should be made
                                some adjustments to make the app feel as welcoming to the dads. This includes creating a
