                    <p class="case-description">'The Wardrobe' is an app created for the costume department at The Royal Danish Ballet's school in Odense, in which the 
                        employees can do online searches among their 1000+ costumes.
                        When planning plays and performances, and especially the school's annual Christmas performance, they plan which costumes they can reuse from the 
                        existing wardrobe. This is partly to save money and to recycle textiles where possible. However, before the app was created, they
                        didn't have an immediate way to get a clear overview of which costumes are in the wardrobe, and therefore needed a solution to access the costumes digitally.  
<br><br>
The app was developed in collaboration with a backend developer.

                <h2 class="case-title">THE PROBLEM</h2>
                <p class="case-description">The school's creative staff often have meetings in the school's office, which is located on the top floor. From here they 
                    talk about costumes that are in the basement, and often an employee has to go down to the basement to check if a certain costume is there, or if 
                    there is something similar they can use. This can result in a lot of trips up and down the stairs for the staff during a meeting.
                    <br> <br>

                    The creative staff have therefore expressed that they need a digital solution where they can search for specific costumes based on colours, 
                    categories and the like. The solution must be as cheap to operate as possible, and must be accessible from all digital devices. Furthermore, 
                    the costume department depends on voluntary work, which is why the solution's code must be as simple to maintain as possible.
                </p>

                <p class="hero-text2">
                    How might we be able to access our 1000+ costumes at anytime and from anywhere?
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="user-research-wrapper">
                <h2 class="case-title user-research-padding padding">USER RESEARCH</h2>
                <div class="case-hero-wrapper user-research-padding">
                    <p class="case-description">In order to get an overview of how the school uses the costume department and what challenges they have, I did user 
                        research at the school.

                    </p>

                    <div class="title-text-wrapper">
                        <h3>Contextual Inquiry</h3>
                        <p class="case-description">I did contextual inquiry with the manager of the costume department, where she showed me around the costume room, 
                            while she explained her work processes. First of all, there weren't currently any system, besides color coding done by the leader of the costume department.
                            Besides that, they depended on her memorizing which costumes they have, and with 1000+ costumes, it could tend to be a problem. 
                        </p>

                            <div class="img-wrapper">

                            <p class="case-description">In addition, I conducted a semi-structured interview, where I asked how the leader of the costume department
                                 imagined they would use a possible digital solution. She thought that they would need to access the wardrobe from anywhere in the 
                                 building and from devices such as smartphones and laptops. She also expressed, that they would need some kind of system in the basement 
                                 with letters, to be able to find pieces of costumes at very specific places, to save time.
                            </p>

                        "We need to be able to sit at a meeting at office at the top of the building and talk about costumes that are located in the basement, without having to go up and 
                        down the stairs over and over."
                    </p>

                    <p class="hero-text2">
                        "Also, the costume room is a mess and it should be quick and easy to find a costume."

                    <div class="title-text-wrapper padding">
                        <h3>Storyboarding</h3>
                        <p class="case-description">I created a storyboard to visualize the work processes regarding the costumes and to sketch ideas for the solution. The storyboard
                            showcases the problems arising, when the staff members discuss the costumes at the office on the top of the building. They have to rely on their memory of 
                            what the costume department contains, or send a member down to check the room. 
                        </p>
                    </div>

                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="hero-section-wrapper">
                <h2 class="case-title padding2">DESIGNING THE SOLUTION</h2>
                <p class="case-description">Since the costumes were already sorted by color, I decided, together with the head of the costume department, that
                    we would leave the clothes hanging as they did. Then we decided to create a system where the cases were given a number and the shelves were
                     given a letter. In this way, it could be registered in the solution where exactly the costume pieces were stored.

                     <br><br>
                     Since the solution had to be as cheap and easy to maintain as possible, I decided in collaboration with the back-end developer on the team that the solution 
                     should be created as a PWA (react.js). In this way, there would be only one codebase to maintain and the solution could be accessed from all digital 
                     devices. Prior to starting the design, I created 3 design principles that summarizes
                     the goal of the solution, and to guide me through the design proces:
                </p>

                <p class="hero-text2">
                    Accessible from anywhere. Searching on the go. Cheap and easy to manage. 
                </p>


                <div class="title-text-wrapper padding">
                    <h3>Wireframes</h3>
                    <p class="case-description">As a first step in the design process, I sketched wireframes in order to generate ideas for the design of the solution. I decided that 
                        the design should be based around the core function, which is the search function. In addition, all employees had to be able to add new costumes 
                        to the database, and choose for themselves whether they wanted to insert an existing photo or whether they wanted to take a photo on the spot.
                        Hereafter, they can register where the costume is located and which categories should be connected to the costume.

                    <h3>Searching through 1000+ costumes on the go</h3>
                    <p class="case-description">The solution was built around a database (in FIrebase), where the 1000+ costumes would be stored with associated categories, 
                        such as the color of the clothes, size etc. From within the app, the employee can search the relevant categories in relation to the costumes they 
                        want to find. When they press search, all costumes that match the entered categories appear. From here they can select the desired costumes and 
                        see their specific location in the costume room. They can also read or note themselves, if there needs to be a comment connected to a certain costume or
                        accessory.

                <div class="case-hero-wrapper user-research-padding">
                    <p class="case-description">I conducted a usability test among the leader of the costume department and a volunteer, to examine whether the solution was
                        usable and user-friendly. The usability test was performed as a Retrospective Think Aloud, where the participants got a set of photos of costumes 
                        that they had to find themselves in the costume department, using only the app to search for their location. I walked behind the participants while
                        they performed the tasks, to see how they handled the tasks. Afterwards, they were asked to describe their thoughts about the proces. <br><br>
                        The usability tests were 100% succesful and they both completed the tasks without needing any assistence during the test. While observing the participants, 
                        I experienced that they didn't hesitate at any point, and after they found the costumes in the app, they walked right to the correct spot and found the costume.
                    </p>

                    <p class="hero-text2">
                        "That was really easy. When I got the photos of the costumes I had to find, I just put tags into the search field in the app, that I thought
                        described the costume (like color or category) and then I found the location of the costume. It was also very easy to find it in the actual room"

                    <p class="case-description">After delivering the app, I have helped getting started with adding costume items to the database, to see how well the 
                        app performs in real life. There were a few issues revolving the sizes of the images making the app a bit slow, but it was resolved by compressing
                        the images when uploading them. Moving on from this, I will check back with the costume department after some time has went by, to get feedback from them
                        about the performance of the app in their daily tasks and if further improvements needs to be made.
