                            <p class="case-description">'The Wardrobe' is an app created for the
                                costume department at The Royal Danish Ballet's school in Odense, in which the
                                employees can do online searches among their 1000+ costumes. Before the app was created,
                                they
                                didn't have an immediate way to get a clear overview of which costumes are in the
                                wardrobe,
                                and therefore needed a solution to access the costumes digitally.</p>

                    <h2 class="case-title">The problem</h2>
                    <p class="case-description">The school's creative staff often have meetings in the school's office,
                        which is located on the top floor of the school. From here they
                        discuss costumes that are located in the basement, and oftentimes an employee has to run up and
                        down the stairs to
                        go look for a costume.
                        This can result in a lot of trips up and down the
                        stairs during a meeting.
                        <br> <br>

                        Therefore, the creative staff wants a digital solution where they can get a clear overview of
                        all the costumes in the basement.
                        Furthermore, the costume department depends on
                        voluntary work, which is why the solution must be cheap and easy to maintain.

                                while she explained her work processes. First of all, there weren't currently any
                                system, besides color coding done by the leader of the costume department.
                                Besides that, they depended on her memorizing which costumes they have, and with 1000+
                                costumes, it could tend to be a problem.

                                asked the leader of the costume department how she imagined that they would use a
                                digital solution.
                                She wanted access to the wardrobe from anywhere in the
                                building and from devices such as smartphones and laptops. She also
                                wanted some kind of system in the basement
                                with letters and numbers, to be able to find pieces of costumes at very specific places.

                            down the stairs over and over. Also, the costume room is a mess and it should be quick and
                            easy to find a costume."

                                office on the top of the building. Right now, they have to rely on
                                their memory of which costumes are in the basement, or send a member down to check the
                                room.

                    <h2 class="case-title">Designing a wardrobe app</h2>
                    <p class="case-description">Since the costumes were already sorted by color, I decided, together
                        with the head of the costume department, that
                        we would leave the clothes hanging as they did. Then we decided to create a system where the
                        cases were given a number and the shelves were
                        given a letter. <br><br>
                        The solution had to be as cheap and easy to maintain as possible, which is why I decided in collaboration with the back-end developer 
                        on the team that the solution should be created as a PWA. In this way, there would be only one codebase to maintain
                        and the solution could be accessed from all digital
                        devices. Prior to starting the design I created 2 design principles that summarizes the goal of
                        the solution, and to guide me through the design proces:</p>

                    <p class="hero-text2 italic">
                        Searching on the go. Cheap and easy to manage.

                        <h3>Wireframes</h3>
                        <p class="case-description">To generate ideas for the solution's design, I sketched several
                            wireframes. It was decided that the design's core function would be the search function. In addition, all employees should be
                            able to add new costumes to the app with relevant tags and the placement
                            of the costume in the costume room. </p>

                        <h3>The final product</h3>
                        <p class="case-description">The solution was built upon a Realtime Database, where the 1000+ costumes would be stored with associated categories,
                                such as the color of the clothes, size etc. When an employee wants to find a
                            particular costume, they can press the picture to
                            find the placement of the costume in the basement.

                        <p class="case-description">I conducted a usability test among the head of the costume
                            department and a volunteer to examine whether the solution was
                            usable and user-friendly. They both got a set of photos of costumes that they themselves had
                            to find in the costume room using only the app.
                            <br><br>
                            I followed them as they performed the tasks to see how they handled them.
                           The usability tests were 100% succesful and they both completed the tasks
                                without needing any assistence during. Also, thanks to the letters and numbers system, they were able to locate the 
                                costumes very quickly.

                            "That was really easy. When I got the photos of the costumes I had to find, I just put tags

                            described the costume (like color or category) and then I found the location of the

                        <p class="case-description">After delivering the app, I have helped getting started with adding
                            costume items to the database, to see how well the
                            app performs in real life. There were a few issues revolving the sizes of the images making
                            the app a bit slow, but it was resolved by compressing
                            the images when uploading them. Moving on from this, I will check back with the costume
                            department after some time has went by, to get feedback from them
                            about the performance of the app in their daily tasks and if further improvements needs to
                            be made.
