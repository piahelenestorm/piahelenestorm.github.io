                            The school's creative staff often have meetings in the school's office, which is located on
                            the
                            top floor of the school. From here they discuss costumes that are located in the basement,
                            and
                            oftentimes an employee has to run up and down the stairs to go look for a costume. This can
                            result in a lot of trips up and down the stairs during a meeting.

                            Therefore, the creative staff wants a digital solution where they can get a clear overview
                            of
                            all the costumes in the basement.

                            the head of the costume department. She gave me a tour of the costume room, while she
                            explained her work processes. There weren't any organization system, besides basic color coding, and she currently were the
                            only one from the staff who had an idea of which costumes where in the basement.

                                To visualize the problems arising when the employees had creative meetings about anything
                                costume-related, and to generate ideas for
                                the solution, I created a storyboard. It was clear from start, that what they really needed was
                                a solution built around a search function,
                                in which they could search for very specific items. Therefore I sketched several wireframes with
                                a search function as the design's core, and
                                with an idea for a way to organize the clothes in boxes and shelves labelled with letters and

                                that they themselves had to find in the costume room using only the app.
        
                                I followed them as they performed the tasks to see how they handled them. The usability tests
                                were 100% succesful and they both completed the tasks without needing any assistence during.
                                Also, thanks to the letters and numbers system, they were able to locate the costumes very

                        After delivering the app, I have helped getting started
                        with adding
                        costume items to the database, to see how well the
                        app performs in real life. There were a few issues revolving the sizes of the images making
                        the app a bit slow, but it was resolved by compressing
                        the images when uploading them. Moving on from this, I will check back with the costume
                        department after some time has went by, to get feedback from them
                        about the performance of the app in their daily tasks and if further improvements needs to
                        be made. (This case only shows a small sample of the user research that has been conducted
                        during the project. If you would like to hear more about our work, please feel free to contact me at piahelenestorm@gmail.com)
