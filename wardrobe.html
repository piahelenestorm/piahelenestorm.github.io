                    <p class="text-dark padding-text">
                        The school's creative staff often have meetings in the school's office, which is located on the
                        top floor of the school. From here they discuss costumes that are located in the basement, and
                        oftentimes an employee has to run up and down the stairs to go look for a costume. This can
                        result in a lot of trips up and down the stairs during a meeting.

                        Therefore, the creative staff wants a digital solution where they can get a clear overview of
                        all the costumes in the basement.

                    <p class="text-dark padding padding-bottom2">
                        To understand how the school uses the costume department and which challenges they
                        have, I did user research, including a contextual inquiry and a semistructured interview with
                        the head of the
                        costume department. She gave me a tour of the costume room, while she explained her work
                        processes. There weren't
                        currently any organization system, besides basic color coding, and she currently were the only
                        one from the staff
                        who had an idea of which costumes where in the basement.

                    <p class="text-dark padding-text">
                        To visualize the problems arising when the employees had creative meetings about anything
                        costume-related, and to generate ideas for
                        the solution, I created a storyboard. It was clear from start, that what they really needed was
                        a solution built around a search function,
                        in which they could search for very specific items. Therefore I sketched several wireframes with
                        a search function as the design's core, and
                        with an idea for a way to organize the clothes in boxes and shelves labelled with letters and
                        numbers.

                        I conducted a usability test among the head of the costume department and a volunteer to examine
                        whether the solution was usable and user-friendly. They both got a set of photos of costumes
                        that they themselves had to find in the costume room using only the app.

                        I followed them as they performed the tasks to see how they handled them. The usability tests
                        were 100% succesful and they both completed the tasks without needing any assistence during.
                        Also, thanks to the letters and numbers system, they were able to locate the costumes very
                        quickly.

                    <p class="text-dark padding-text">
                        After delivering the app, I have helped getting started
                        with adding
                        costume items to the database, to see how well the
                        app performs in real life. There were a few issues revolving the sizes of the images making
                        the app a bit slow, but it was resolved by compressing
                        the images when uploading them. Moving on from this, I will check back with the costume
                        department after some time has went by, to get feedback from them
                        about the performance of the app in their daily tasks and if further improvements needs to
                        be made. (This case only shows a small sample of the user research that has been conducted
                        during the project. If you would like to hear more about our work or just want to meet for a
